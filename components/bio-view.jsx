                <h1>About Zach Stark</h1>
                <p>I graduated from Viterbo University of La Crosse, WI in 2012 with a BBA in Computer Information Systems and a BFA in Studio Art. Not a traditional combination of degrees but I found a lot of joy from both programs.</p>
                <p>I chose information systems as I enjoyed working with and around computers. This started mostly because I was always building and replacing parts in computers and always having software & hardware issues to debug. A strong family history of entrepreneurial activity gave me a lot of insight into business and a BBA simply felt natural. Web development started soon after graduation as I desired a means to keep and expand upon my skills. This would eventually lead me to my chosen career field.</p>
                <p>The BFA was a personal ambition, a personal driver. The challenge was always trying to figure out what I liked about it and how I could improve. Its not just the end idea, the final image, but also the craftsmanship and effort surrounding it. The idea is critical to me and me alone; however, how it is presented to the viewer to express that idea is just as much if not more so challenging. The more abstract the work the more difficult it is to engage the viewer as such the challenge, fun, and personal interest increases.</p>
                <p>I am a thoughtful, methodical person where I pay special attention to everything. I treat my artwork with the best craftsmanship I can and absolutely love laboring over the details. Presentation is everything and the effort is often recognized. I extend this mentality to my coding. Everything is well thought out and refined over time. Clean, well-documented, efficient code is the way I'd like to leave everything. I'm still working in the visual spectrum, creating and building, except this time its code.</p>
                <p>In the end you're going to find me to be a light-hearted, hard-working, and humble person. I enjoy what I do and love working with others whether it is sharing the experience or collaborating for something better.</p>
